# Class Kudos
This is a behavior tracking site for teachers/instructors. Based on similar sites such as ClassDojo, you can award points to students for behaviors.

## What's Different?
What makes Class Kudos different is the ability for students to redeem their own points for pre-set rewards. Teachers can see what has been redeeded by their students, or redeem awards for students on their own. Teachers can also created two types of groupings, "classes" and "groups".  This abstraction lets teachers create long term groupings of students in a "class" while also creating completely separate "groups" of students for the purposes of temporary groupings, small groups within a class, etc.
